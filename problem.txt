Given an undirected graph G having positive weights and N vertices.
You start with having a sum of M money. For passing through a vertex i, you must pay S[i] money. If you don’t have enough 
money – you can’t pass through that vertex.
Find the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex N, respecting the above conditions; or state that such path doesn’t exist.
If there exist more than one path having the same length, then output the cheapest one. 
Restrictions: 1<N<=100 ; 0<=M<=100 ; for each i, 0<=S[i]<=100. Also S[i]=i for this problem.
